## Overview

**SPlayer-Next-Headless-Android** is a next-generation modern music player tailored specifically for the Android mobile platform.

The project is built on **Capacitor + Vue 3 + TypeScript**, bridging low-level operating system capabilities through customized Android native plugins:

- **Audio Architecture**: Powered by Android native **Media3 / ExoPlayer**, running on a dedicated `SPlayerPlayback` audio thread to manage playback, preloading, and system `MediaSession` integration;
- **Foreground Playback Service**: Implemented in native Kotlin (`PlaybackService`) to ensure seamless lock screen controls, headset remote commands, and persistent background playback without system kills;
- **Dual-Mode Lyric Engine**: Combining a hardware-accelerated native Android Canvas overlay with a Web physics animation engine, supporting dynamic line-by-line blur and floating dynamic island lyrics;
- **Embedded Mobile Runtime**: Bundling Node.js Mobile and a lightweight NanoHTTPD proxy to handle online API resolution, lyric fetching, and plugins locally on the device.

## Features

- 🎵 **Wide Audio Format Support** — MP3, FLAC, WAV, AAC, OGG, and more, decoded via Media3 and native Android audio pipelines
- 📝 **Rich Lyric Experience** — Support for TTML, QRC, KRC, YRC, LRC, LYS, and ASS, with word-by-word dynamic highlighting, line-by-line blur transitions, and floating dynamic island lyrics
- 📱 **Modern Mobile Interaction** — Touch-optimized FullPlayer interface with fluid FLIP-based Hero shared element transitions and gesture controls
- 🛡️ **Foreground Persistence** — Kotlin native `PlaybackService` with lock screen controls and system MediaSession notifications for reliable background playback
- 🎙️ **Audio Capture & Recognition** — Integrated native audio recording (AudioRecord) and music recognition services
- 📁 **Local Music Library** — High-performance local library scanning and tag management via Android Storage Access Framework (SAF), jaudiotagger, and native SQLite
- 🌐 **Streaming Server Support** — Seamless connection and streaming with Subsonic, Navidrome, Jellyfin, and Emby
- 🎨 **Adaptive Color Theming** — Real-time dynamic theme generation extracted from album covers, supporting Dark/Light modes and immersive edge-to-edge system bars
- 🎚️ **Real-Time Spectrum** — Low-overhead hardware FFT visualization
- ⚡ **Embedded Mobile API Service** — Built-in local Node.js Mobile runtime powering online resolution and plugin ecosystems

## Development

### Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 22
- **pnpm** >= 10
- **JDK** 21 (Required for Android compilation; JDK 17 or lower will fail)
- **Android SDK** (API 34/35 support) and **Android NDK**

### Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (applies nodejs-mobile patches automatically)
pnpm install

# 2. Start Web UI dev server (launches Android UI and dev API in browser)
pnpm exec vite --config vite.config.android.ts --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Android Build Pipeline

```bash
# Full Android build pipeline (Web bundle -> Cap sync -> Node bundle -> Embedded assets)
pnpm build:android

# Build native APKs (inside android directory)
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug    # Build Debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Build Release APK
```

### Linting & Verification

```bash
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check (tsc + vue-tsc)
pnpm lint             # ESLint check
pnpm format           # Prettier code formatting
pnpm android:check    # Kotlin static check & compilation (ktlintCheck + compileKotlin + detekt, JDK 21 required)
pnpm android:format   # Kotlin code formatting (ktlintFormat)
```
